      <h1>My Local Development Environment Setup in 2019</h1>

      <hr>

      <p>I've been a web developer for about 5 years now which means that I have shuffled around how I set-up my local development environment. I also have the luxury to work on multiple operating systems -- macOS on my work computer, Linux on my personal desktop PC and Windows 10 Home on my personal laptop PC.</p>
      
      <p>Fortunately, most of the technologies I use are cross-platform. These include HTML, CSS, Javascript but mostly Python. I'm a back-end developer who uses the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web framework and lately I've been doing some website scraping tasks using the <a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a> framework.</p>

      <h3>De facto setup</h3>

      <p>I could probably just download the respective installers for the respective tools and install them all locally to the machine's OS.</p>
