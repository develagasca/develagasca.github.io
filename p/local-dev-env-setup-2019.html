    <h1>Local Development Environment Setup (2019)</h1>
    <aside><em>2019-08-06</em></aside>

    <p>I'm a web developer and I also regularly reformat and re-install the OS of my computers. Right now, I have access
      to 3 computers &mdash; a Mac mini at work and both a personal laptop and desktop at home. It's given that my work
      Mac mini uses macOS. My personal laptop runs on Windows 10 Home and the desktop uses the Pop!OS Linux
      distribution. That's three different operating systems to setup my local development environment on.</p>

    <p>I use macOS the most, as I spend most of my web development time at the office. But even though macOS is Unix
      based, I prefer Linux. I like the tooling and the superior package management of Linux.</p>

    <h2>Containerization vs Virtualization</h2>

    <p>Two ways to use Linux in macOS is either through <em>containerization</em> or <em>virtualization</em>.</p>

    <h3>Docker</h3>

    <p><a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> seemed a good way to go as containers are smaller than virtual
      machines. And I was happily using it for a time &mdash; until the Docker daemon kept crashing and I had to
      occasionally reset it every week which deleted all the downloaded Docker images from the system. I also noticed
      that it would also cause my Mac to randomly stall and freeze for a few minutes.</p>

    <p>Also, although Docker was supported by the major OSes, I only had Windows 10 Home edition on my laptop which does
      not permit running <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> natively
      unless I upgrade to Windows 10 Pro&hellip;because <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Micro$oft</a>.</p>

    <p><em>I know that I can install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/">Docker Toolbox
          on Windows</a> for Windows 10 Home but that is just basically running Docker through a VM.</em></p>

    <p>So I decided to leave Docker and look elsewhere.</p>

    <h3>Vagrant</h3>

    <p>I switched to vanilla <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> where I create my Linux VMs manually
      from installation till configuration which became tedious pretty fast. Good thing I discovered <a
        href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> which, like Docker, could spawn a virtual environment from a file
      where all the configurations go.</p>

    <p>Vagrant is cross platform as well, supporting the major OSes. And since I can run VirtualBox on Windows 10 Home
      no problem, it was also a good fit.</p>

    <p>And so as of this post, I am using Vagrant to handle the creation, configuration and management of my local
      development environment.</p>
