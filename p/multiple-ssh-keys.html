    <h1>Multiple SSH Keys for Remote DVCS</h1>
    <aside><em>2019-09-12</em></aside>

    <hr>

    <p>
      I have multiple developer accounts with remote DVCS services like BitBucket, GitHub and GitLab. This is because I have both work and personal accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, on GitHub I get the ff. error when I try to add the same SSH key I used for my work account to my personal account:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="/static/images/multiple-ssh-keys-01.gif" alt="Key is already in use error">
    </p>

    <p>
      The logical thing to do is to create an SSH key for each account &mdash; this is simple. But there needs to be additional steps so that git doesn't get confused which SSH key to use when cloning, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Create the SSH keys</h2>

    <p>
      Using the <em>ssh-keygen</em> command, create the SSH keys. In my case I will make two, one for work and another for my personal account.
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">
      $ ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -C "work@email.com" <br>
      &hellip; <br>
      $ ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -C "personal@email.com" <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I use <em>ed25519</em> but you can use <em>rsa</em> just make sure it's 4096 bits i.e. <em>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"</em>. You may also add a passphrase; it's not required but recommended.
    </p>

    <h2>Create the <span class="code">~/.ssh/config</span> file</h2>

    <p>
      Inside the <span class="code">~/.ssh</span> folder, edit (or create if it doesn't exist) the <span class="code">config</span> file. This file is where we configure which SSH key to use for which account.
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">
      # personal SSH key <br>
      Host personal.github.com <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HostName github.com <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IdentitiesOnly yes <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal <br>
      <br>
      # work SSH key <br>
      Host work.github.com <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HostName github.com <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IdentitiesOnly yes <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      The value after the <em>Host</em> may be whatever you want it to be. Just remember that it is what you use when cloning with Git.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally change the file mode for <span class="code">config</span> to 600. I experienced an error because of wrong file mode.
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">
      $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
    </p>

    </aside>

    <h2>Clone accordingly</h2>

    <p>
      Now it's time to clone the projects. Normally when using git with SSH keys, cloning is done this way:
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">
      $ git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
    </p>

    <p>
      But since we have 2 accounts in 1 computer that uses SSH keys, using the above command confuses git which SSH key to use. This is where the <em>config</em> we did earlier comes in. Remember the value after the <em>Host</em> declaration? That's what you put as the host when doing <span class="code">git clone &hellip;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">
      $ # cloning using personal SSH key <br>
      $ git clone git@<strong>personal.github.com</strong>:username/repository.git <br>
      &hellip; <br>
      $ # cloning using work SSH key <br>
      $ git clone git@<strong>work.github.com</strong>:username/repository.git
    </p>

    <p>
      If all goes well then cloning git repositories won't end in error.
